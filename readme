I am using Mongo as Database. The reason I choose Mongo is => in my Laravel project I used MySql, so I wanted to learn something new. And I heard a lot about Mongo, so I thought I should learn it.
    I used nodemon. and embedded js. Also used Cookies in my website. 
    For frontend I used= https://startbootstrap.com/ but Ofcourse I modified it like i wanted.
    When I was stuck I asked help to my questions in  Stackoverflow - Chatgpt - Claude.
    Also watched many different youtube tutorials and searched information myself.
